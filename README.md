Building Your First Circuit

Components Required





Light Emitting Diode (LED) - Can be any colour but I'm using a white one



Resistor (220 Ohm recommended)



2 Jumper wires (male to male)



Breadboard



Arduino Uno (ofc lol)

Light Emitting Diode (LED)





Allows current to flow in only one direction (anode to cathode).



Emits light when electrons pass through it.



Anode (longer leg) must be connected to positive voltage; cathode (shorter leg) to ground (GND)



Resistors





Limits the flow of current to protect the LED from burning out.



Resistance measured in ohms, calculated based on voltage and current requirements.


FOR OUR BREADBOARD 
Ground goes to - and positive goes to our current 
for Our main part of the breadboard wires on the same column are connected while wires on different columns are not connected etc 



Here is the link to the online calculator which calculate what resistor you need based on your LED (Calculator)
